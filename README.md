## 🧠 Current Focus

- Shipping runnable playbooks for autonomous-agent infrastructure (not just docs)
- Leveraging launchd + local automations for always-on workflows (e.g., birthday reminders, monitoring loops)
- Building memory-first products with React 19, Supabase, Node/Express, and Vercel deployments
